# PowerBI_As_Low_Code | Quantum Harmony Semantic Loop DevOps 


A repeatable development framework that bridges low-code platforms, demonstrating the ability for AI to complement the changing workforce landscape by promoting Human In Loop polices for agents.

## ⚙️ The Vision 

**Quantum Harmony** is a working proof-of-concept for a new kind of DevOps system:
one where data architecture, semantic clarity, and AI augmentation are integrated from the start—*not bolted on after deployment.* Building out this flow using LLM models to generate code exploring how much impact AI could have on the low code space.  

It’s built to empower:
- Low-code builders with architectural structure
- Devs with semantic clarity before they ever write code
- Teams with an iterative, testable loop for development that doesn’t break production

This system uses **Power BI as a semantic sandbox**, **Copilot as a schema generator**, and **Dataverse/Power Platform as a delivery layer**, forming a feedback loop that validates logic, not just syntax. The Azure platform reduces a lot of overhead auth complexity

## 🚀 Why It Matters

Traditional DevOps workflows aren’t built for citizen developers.
And most low-code environments move faster than their governance models can keep up.

Quantum Harmony aims to fix that—by treating **semantic modeling as the dev environment** and making **human-supervised AI** part of the loop, not just the input.

This framework helps teams:
- Rapidly prototype schema with AI (Copilot)
- Refine logic and relationships in a semantic-first Power BI layer
- Push clean, validated structure back to Dataverse or SQL
- Keep dev and ops moving *together*, not against each other

## 🧠 Method Overview

> **Semantic Loop DevOps** is a methodology where data modeling is done in Power BI before writing permanent schema.
> AI (Copilot) assists in generating early structure, and that structure is refined, tested, and proven *semantically* before any deployment.

### Workflow:

1. **Generate**: Use AI/Copilot to draft a schema
2. **Ingest**: Bring the schema into Power BI for refinement
3. **Refine**: Define relationships, DAX, roles, hierarchies
4. **Validate**: Test the model visually with real or dummy data
5. **Export**: Rebuild the schema in your DB or Dataverse, informed by proven logic
6. **Loop**: Use the refined semantic model to guide AI or developer decisions on the next iteration

## 🌱 Why I Built This

To show that DevOps doesn’t have to be gatekeeping.
To prove that **ops** can move at the speed of **dev**—without breaking things.
And to put structure around the role of AI, so it empowers humans instead of bypassing them.

Also, if Microsoft or OpenAI is reading this:
Yes. I’ve thought this through. Let’s talk.

## 🧪 How to Use This Repo

- Clone it, drop in your schema drafts
- Use the Power BI file as a sandbox for testing relationships, DAX, structure
- Follow the loop to push logic back into Dataverse or your database
- Extend the prompts or scripts to plug in your own use case
