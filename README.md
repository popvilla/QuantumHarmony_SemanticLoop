# Quantum Harmony Semantic Loop DevOps

A repeatable development framework that bridges low-code platforms, semantic modeling, and human-in-the-loop AI‚Äîbringing DevOps principles to the modern citizen developer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What This Project Is

**Quantum Harmony** is a working proof-of-concept for a new kind of DevOps system:
one where data architecture, semantic clarity, and AI augmentation are integrated from the start‚Äî*not bolted on after deployment.*

It‚Äôs built to empower:
- Low-code builders with architectural structure
- Devs with semantic clarity before they ever write code
- Teams with an iterative, testable loop for development that doesn‚Äôt break production

This system uses **Power BI as a semantic sandbox**, **Copilot as a schema generator**, and **Dataverse/Power Platform as a delivery layer**, forming a feedback loop that validates logic, not just syntax.

## üöÄ Why It Matters

Traditional DevOps workflows aren‚Äôt built for citizen developers.
And most low-code environments move faster than their governance models can keep up.

Quantum Harmony aims to fix that‚Äîby treating **semantic modeling as the dev environment** and making **human-supervised AI** part of the loop, not just the input.

This framework helps teams:
- Rapidly prototype schema with AI (Copilot)
- Refine logic and relationships in a semantic-first Power BI layer
- Push clean, validated structure back to Dataverse or SQL
- Keep dev and ops moving *together*, not against each other
