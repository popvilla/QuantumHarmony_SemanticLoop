# Quantum Harmony — Semantic Loop DevOps

## 🌌 Vision

Quantum Harmony is a **human–AI symbiosis project** designed to bring structure, ethics, and operational clarity to low-code and AI-augmented development environments. It is a living system: part DevOps, part Semantic Modeling Lab, part Governance Manifest.

At its core, Quantum Harmony treats **Power BI as an IDE** for semantic modeling, **Dataverse as the source of truth**, and **AI (Copilot, Codex)** as scaffolding assistants—not architects. The goal: build resilient, ethical, human-supervised systems before vendor defaults reshape the stack.

## ⚙️ Core Methodology: Semantic Loop DevOps

A repeatable workflow for AI-augmented builds:

1. **Generate** — Use Copilot/LLMs to draft schema and logic scaffolding.
2. **Refine** — Import draft into **Power BI IDE**; validate relationships, measures, hierarchies, semantics.
3. **Validate** — Test business logic with visuals, filters, and metrics.
4. **Commit** — Export validated schema into JSON/docs.
5. **Deploy** — Back-port to **Dataverse/SQL** with ALM discipline.
6. **Feedback Loop** — Feed refined semantic models back into AI for documentation, UI scaffolds, and next-gen prompts.

This loop enforces **human-in-the-loop governance**, semantic precision, and versioned accountability.

## 🛡️ Guardrails & Governance

- **AI Memory Guardrail**: No silent schema or flow changes; all must be logged + reviewed.
- **Provenance Tracking**: Separate human-authored vs AI-suggested outputs.
- **Vendor Drift Log**: Capture when Microsoft/AI platform changes disrupt the system.
- **Human in the Loop**: Final say on deployments, destructive edits, and schema integrity.

## 🔭 Why This Matters

Microsoft’s roadmap (Power Platform + Copilot + Purview) is converging toward **AI-augmented DevOps**. But governance is reactive, not proactive. Quantum Harmony is

## 🚀 Next Steps

- [ ] Wire Dataverse schemas into live Power Pages portal
- [ ] Build Reviewer App with anonymized scoring
- [ ] Expand CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions + ALM discipline)
- [ ] Automate schema push from Power BI → Dataverse
- [ ] Publish Semantic Loop DevOps as a repeatable methodology
